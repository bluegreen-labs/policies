# Consultancy policy

Our time is limited and requests for help using or reproducing our projects are frequent. 
Where substantial intellectual input is required we ask for credit. 
Intellectual input can take the form of (but is not limited to) custom code, 
data manipulation, methodological advice (including experimental design) and 
editorial work outside the scope of general journal requests.

The form of credit is negotiable and depends on the exact circumstance, but can include (and is not necessarily limited to):

- Authorship on manuscripts or other research products resulting from work where we have made these contributions
- Authorship on grant proposals where applicable
- Consultancy through a service contract with one of our partners

> For simple questions regarding the functioning of our open source software, or previously published work, 
> we do not apply a consultancy policy. Simple acknowledgements and properly cited software or literature would suffice.
