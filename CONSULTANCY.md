# Consultancy policy

Our time is limited and requests for help using, or reproducing our projects, are frequent. Where intellectual input is required we ask for credit. Credit involves either small consulting contracts for well defined tasks (scope of work), or billable hours for intermittent support (e.g. advisory calls). For larger projects we prefer to be a formal partner with an allocated budget and well defined project outlines.

## EU CRA compliance

If you need help with any of our open-source software we can only provide this, legally, to you when you BUY OUR SOFTWARE first. We will then ship you the EU CRA approved version. The price is set by the liability taken on through the project. We are sorry about this inconvenience and financial overhead. Please talk to your EU representative to adjust the EU CRA for Small and Medium Sized companies and hybrid open-source consulting venues.
