# Consultancy policy

Our time is limited and requests for help using, or reproducing our projects, are frequent. Where intellectual input is required we ask for credit. Credit involves either small consulting contracts for well defined tasks (scope of work), or billable hours for intermittent support (e.g. advisory calls). For larger projects we prefer to be a formal partner with an allocated budget and well defined project outlines.
