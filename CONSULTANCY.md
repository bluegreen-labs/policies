# Consultancy policy

Our time is limited and requests for help using, or reproducing our projects, are frequent. Where intellectual input is required we ask for credit. Credit involves either small consulting contracts for well defined tasks (scope of work), or billable hours for intermittent support (e.g. advisory calls). For larger projects we prefer to be a formal partner with an allocated budget and well defined project outlines.

## [EU CRA compliance](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act)

Due to poor scope of the [European Union Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA) regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act), if formal support is needed we are required to charge you for a new bespoke open-source software copy (regardless of it being open-source already). The price will be set by the potential liability incured.  As such, BlueGreen Labs does not monetize any of the projects below. Please talk to your EU representative to adjust the EU CRA for Small and Medium Sized companies and hybrid open-source consulting venues.
